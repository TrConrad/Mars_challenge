# Mars_challenge

This challenge was an excerise in webscraping using jupyter notebook, HTML and CSS, as well as Splinter and BeautifulSoup. This challenge focused on extracting data from a website, which was then analyzed to answer questions. The first jupyter notebook file focused on extracting article titles and summaries, which were then altered for better legibility. These titles and summaries were then complied into a dictionary with the key value pair of "title" and "preview." The second file web scraped data from a table, which was then imported into a Pandas dataframe, which became the basis for the analysis the second file. This Dataframe was used to create multiple bar charts aas well as a line graph to analyze weather patterns on Mars, such as the months with the highest and lowest  atmospheric pressure. The second file also contained five weather analysis questions that were answered in file.
